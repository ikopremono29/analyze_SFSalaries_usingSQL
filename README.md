# analyze_SFSalaries_usingSQL
Simple analysis exercise of San Fransisco annual salaries dataset using SQL from 2011 to 2014

The San Fransisco annual salaries dataset is derived from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/sf-salaries), with Public Domain license.

Here, I tried to explore some simple steps we can do using SQL such as:
  1. Filtering unwanted data
  2. Finding the highest earner for each year
  3. Getting to know engineer's earning
  4. Grouping job titles and their average total earning

We might explore other things, but hopefully this is very useful especially for those who is getting started to learn SQL.
